PhD student in NLP at Sorbonne University from 2022 to 2025. After obtaining my master's degree in Computer Science and Language at Sorbonne University, I decided to start my PhD under the supervision of [Gaël Lejeune](https://www.lejeunegael.fr/), [Antoine Gautier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antoinegautier/?originalSubdomain=fr) and [Gilles Siouffi](https://lettres.sorbonne-universite.fr/personnes/gilles-siouffi). I work on the automatic recognition of unfrozen expressions.

Interests
======

Right now, I'm interested in the nature of the exchanges between computer science and language science. Like many people, I think that these two disciplines have a lot to contribute to each other. This is one of the lines of thought of my PhD : Can we imagine that by a virtuous circle phenomenon, automated processing can refine the linguistic description at the same time as it allows to adjust the computer tools ?

My phd subject led me to study Multiword Expressions (MWEs) processing in NLP. I'm particularly interested in Unfrozen Multiword Expressions (UMWEs), which can be described as extreme cases of MWEs variations. What's not to love about a process that can transform a famous recipe like *duck confit* into an *asshole conflict*, or notorious advertising slogans like *eat 5 fruits and vegetables a day* into *eat 5 richs and vegetables a day* ?

At the moment, we are working on [le Défricheur](https://ceres.huma-num.fr/defricheur/), a gamified annotation platform to help annotate UMWEs in our tweets dataset. As for now, this platform is only available in French. I also developed a tool for automatic unfrozen multiword identification in text: ASMR (Align, Segment, Match, Rank).
